# Computer-Vision-Project
Developed a computer vision system to automatically detect photophobia by analyzing multimodal facial (expressions) and eye movement data. Utilized a CNN to process video frames capturing pupil dilation, blinking, and squinting under different lighting conditions for real-time discomfort detection.
